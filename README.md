## 📝 **Project Guidelines & Reminders**

✔ **Node-Based System** – Godot uses a node-based structure with underlying layers.

✔ **Organized Project Structure:**
   - **`assets/`** → Images, audio, and other game assets.
   - **`scenes/`** → Contains all added game scenes.
   - **`scripts/`** → Stores all GDScript (`.gd`) and other programming scripts.

✔ **Attach Scripts** – When adding mechanics (e.g., physics, dialogue), attach a script to the scene to ensure functionality.

✔ **Follow Godot Tutorials** – [Official Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html)
